**Three main branches of theory:**
- models of computing (automata theory)
**Finite state Automata**
A finite state automata has a finite number of states that it can be. (limited by memory)
There are two types of FSAs:
  - DFA (deterministic finite automata)
    - used for text processing
    - hardware design
    - compiler design
    - natural languages
  - NDFA (non-deterministic finite automata)
