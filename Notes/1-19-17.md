**Three main branches of theory:**
- models of computing (automata theory)

**Finite state Automata**

A finite state automata has a finite number of states that it can be. (limited by memory)
There are two types of FSAs:
  - DFA (deterministic finite automata)
    - used for text processing
    - hardware design
    - compiler design
    - natural languages
  - NDFA (non-deterministic finite automata)

 The langauge that a finite state machine uses is the input that it accepts. Finite state machines are defined by a quintuple:
 1. Q --> Finite set of states
 2. Sigma --> FInite set that is not empty
 3. Delta --> transition function (usually represented in a table)
 4. q<sub>0</sub> Q --> start state
 5. F Q  --> Set of accept states

M<sub>1</sub> = ({q<sub>0</sub>, q<sub>1</sub>}, {0, 1}, Delta, q<sub>0</sub>, {q<sub>1</sub>})

Accept states are denoted by having an extar circle around them
W<sub>1</sub> = 101101 would be accepted since you are at the accepting state of q<sub>1</sub>.

- 0 --> 0 reject
- 1 --> 1 accept
- 2 --> 10 reject
- 3 --> 11 accept
- 4 --> 100 reject
- 5 --> 101 accept
- 6 --> 110 reject
- 7 --> 111 accept
- 8 --> 1000 reject

L(M<sub>1</sub>) = {W | W is a binary string # that is odd}. M<sub>1</sub> recognizes the langauge L.
